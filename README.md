# Candy-Cane-Christmas-2019 :gift:
Apparently I just keep building gifts for Christmas...so this is the present that I built for Christmas 2019! :D  It's a Bluetooth controlled Candy Cane.  Play it as an instrument, let it play christmas songs to you, or just use it as a night light for some wicked LED fun!

## Getting Started

Due to the nature of this project, the code isn't necessarily transferrable to other domains unless you built an LED Candy Cane as well (and if you've built a similar project I would love to see what you created! :smile: )

## Built With

* [Arduino Nano] - The microcontroller used
* [WS2812B RGB 5050 LED Strip] â€“ LEDs inside the snowflake
* [SPDT (Single Pole, Double Throw) Switch]
* [HM10 Bluetooth Module]]
* [1" speaker]
* [9V Battery]


## CAD Files

The necessary STL files are provided in the docs so you can print your own candy cane!  Feel free to modify it how you see fit :smile:
